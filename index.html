        <h2>Life Story Stuff</h2>
        <p>
          There’s a little island off the coast of nowhere in particular, where,
          for reasons no one has ever fully explained, goats outnumber people by
          about 15 to 1. I visited this island during what I call my “wanderlust
          phase,” but honestly, I was just bad at booking flights and ended up
          on the wrong plane. When I arrived, I was greeted by a friendly local
          named Hugo, who insisted that I stay in his family’s ancient stone
          house because “tourists never come here.” Hugo’s house was charming,
          though I could never quite shake the feeling that the goats were
          watching me. One morning, I woke up to find the goats had broken into
          the yard and were now solemnly chewing on my socks, which I had hung
          to dry outside. I spent hours trying to retrieve them, running around
          like a lunatic while the goats effortlessly outsmarted me. By the end
          of the day, I was sockless, exhausted, and oddly contemplative about
          the nature of resilience. Hugo, seeing my plight, decided to cheer me
          up with a local delicacy: a mysterious dish he called "caprine
          delight." I won’t get into the details, but let’s just say it involved
          a lot of yogurt and a suspiciously chewy texture. I politely nibbled
          and then excused myself, wondering if my wanderlust phase had
          officially gone too far. What does this have to do with cookies, you
          ask? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Except that when I finally got home,
          I found myself baking cookies

          <p>
            First of all you need to gather your ingredients and it usually
            helps putting all of them on a table instead of having to get the
            additional ones everytime you move onto the next step. Trust me I
            would know.

            After you gathered everything make sure to weigh them before
            throwing them into the bowl. Now weigh and toss in the vegan butter,
            powdered sugar, vanilla sugar, salt and lastly flour

            After his well deserved rest, get a plastic bag and cut/rip it half.
            Put your well rested dough inbetween the two plastic sheets and
            start going to town on it with a rolling pin. Roll until it feels
            thin enough. Afterwards use a cookie cutter (shape is irrelevant) to
            cut the cookies

            Migrate your freshly cut out cookies onto baking foils and let them
            rest for another hour. Also start pre-heating the oven to 200 degree
            Celsius.

          <p>
            Put your cookies in the middle of your pre-heated oven and wait
            around 6 minutes for them to be baked. They should be slighty brown
            but don't overdo it.

            Put the fresh cookies onto a grid and let them cool for a bit. Now

            jam, Carob jelly and powdered sugar inbetween two cookies.
